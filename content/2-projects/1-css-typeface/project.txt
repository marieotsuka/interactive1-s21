Text: 

Through this project, you will experiment formally in HTML and CSS through creation of your very own typeface. That said, your typeface should somehow take advantage of its unique material. How is a typeface online (on a screen) different from one in a book (on a printed page)? How do the media differ? What are the dynamic properties of the web that printed matter lacks? And vice-versa: is there anything that printed matter has that the web doesn’t? The concept for your typeface should come across formally and also allude to the way it was created (programming HTML and CSS).

Your typeface should exist in at least two visual ‘states.’ These states can take advantage of the HTML/CSS hover state, continuously run like a screensaver, or be triggered via a :hover state. What does this additional form say about the digital format? Is it a means to be expressive? To hide and reveal new information? Are there multiple layers to your typeface that represent different types of information? Connect these visual forms to the concept of your typeface.

When it is time to create the website to display your typeface, consider its subject. How can your website’s focus not only reinforce but push forward the concept of your typeface? How will your typeface be used? What material can you present in your typeface to take it to a new level? Can the website surprise viewers in some way to further explore the concept even more?


###Learning Outcomes
* Consider modularity as a process for systematically and generatively making form
* Understand HTML structure as a way to group elements together
* Learn how to use CSS as a designing and drawing tool
* Explore experimental ways of using web programming


###Requirements

* Create a typeface using only HTML and CSS. It should have a complete character set and at minimum 2 visual ‘states.’
* Once you’ve designed and built your typeface, create a website to display your complete typeface.
* You must give your typeface a name

###Project

**Project Kickoff: Weds Jan 27**
Parametric design and modular type discussion

**Step 1: Due Weds Feb 3**
To get started, first complete a sketch of 2 letters in BW for the [Collective Alphabet Exercise](/projects/collective-alphabet) which will act as inspiration for the project.

Based on this exercise create two unique _modular_ directions for each of your “Collective Alphabet” characters in graphics in a new Figma file. This means 4 designs total. Each character can reuse a concept, or have a totally unique design. 
For this part, the typeface need not be grid-based (based off of a square grid,) but should be reusing a limited kit of parts to construct its forms. 

Please post a link to your Figma file with your alphabet concepts on your class website.


**Step 2: Due Weds Feb 10**
Based on feedback of your two directions, select one for your typeface. Complete your typeface drawing in Figma as much as possible, then begin building your letters in HTML and CSS. Here are the characters I would like you to have:

either: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
or: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
as well as: 0123456789 (numbers) and .?!,”“ (punctuation)

**Step 3: Due Weds Feb 17**
Finalize your proposal (using InDesign, Figma, or another sketching tool) for the website your typeface will live on. How can your website’s focus not only reinforce but push forward the concept of your typeface? Remember to upload the sketches to your class website.
* Ask yourself: What makes a typeface specific to the screen or the web?
* Think about your typeface in two states. (How does your typeface "breathe"?)
* Think about what your typeface would do if it were a screen saver.

**Step 4: Final Crit Weds Mar 3**
Present a final website containing typeface and showcasing its unique character.
