Title: P2 Community Archive

Project: 1

Text: 

In this project, you will create a single-serve site as an events or resource archive for a community you care about. You might document real records for an existing organization; alternatively, you might define some ideal speculative events that may not have happened yet.
 
In this process, you will develop an expressive typographic identity system for your events archive. This system will play out in several compositions within the page — each containing different content types. We will experiment with ways to activate the typography through the browser through interaction and motion.

* How does the typography and interactive states express the theme of the events?
* What information might be important to include for the community?
* What kind of gestural metaphors can you use? How does motion express an idea?


### Learning Outcomes

* Develop skills for typographic display on the screen
* Work with variations on a theme, balancing consistency and contrast
* Experiment and expand the range of typographic expression, including scale variation, typefaces choice, hover-states
* Fluency in CSS for laying out of text content
* Fluency in CSS positioning, transformations, and animations
* Plan for fluid containers and adaptable designs, both aesthetically and structurally

### Requirements

* Each section should be at minimum 100vw x 100vh 
* Designs should be primarily typographic
* Implement at least one animating element that aligns with the concept of the site

### Project

**Project Kickoff: Weds February 24**
Content Collection & Typography Explorations

**Step 1: Due Weds March 3**
First, let’s collect the content for your site. Whether you are researching real events, or creating speculative events, or existing resources define the text for the following:

1. Landing section
- This feels like the “cover” of your book — consider this section as an opening expressive graphic event

2. Schedule
- How might you design a list of these records? 
- Document the details of at least 6 records related to your community, each as its own "web poster".
	- Each must have: Title, Description
	- Events may include Date / time / location, Resources might inlude link / authors / last published date.
	- Think critically about your meta data — think of how the information you’re presenting aligns with the content of your site
- What is the appropriate hiearchy of information for these events? What is the default order?

3. About 
- What is the background information behind the community and this website?

Second, begin sketching out your typographic choices for the design of your site. Using the `/week-5/section2-sketch/` sketch demo in our [demos repository](https://github.com/marieotsuka/interactive1-s21-demos/tree/main/week-5/section2-sketch) as a basis, explore at least 3 different typographic directions for your website. In at least one sketch, use a self-hosted webfont using the @font-face rule.
See [Personalize Your Typography](/projects/personalize-type) and the lectures assigned on Typography for details and resources on font distributors.
