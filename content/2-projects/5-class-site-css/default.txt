To become familiar with CSS stylesheets and links, we’ll add CSS to our personal class sites, and link to the results of our first exercises: “Inspect Element”.

**Instructions Part 1**

First we’ll link to the outcome of our “Inspect Element” exercise.

Locate your screenshot from the “Inspect Element” exercise, and put it in the “root” of your class site repository.

Open the index.html file in the same folder and locate the following code:

```
<h3>Exercises</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">EX 1</a></li>
      </ul>
```

In between the “” marks following the `href` attribute in the `<a>` tag, put the filename of your screenshot. Then in between the opening and closing `<a>` tags, change “EX 1” to “Inspector Sketches”. Your could should look like this:

```
<h3>Exercises</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="screenshot_….png">Inspector Sketches</a></li>
      </ul>
```

Now when you open your class site, you should be able to click to your screenshot!

**Instructions Part 2**

Next we’ll add CSS to our personal sites so we can begin styling them.

In your class site repository folder create a new folder titled “css”. In Sublime text, create a new file and save it as “style.css” within this folder.

In your css folder, add the following code:

```
body { background: pink; }
```

And save the file.

In your the index.html file at the “root” of your class site repository, add the following code:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css">  
```

This will link the CSS file you just created to your index.html file. If everything is done correctly, your page should now be pink!

Continue to play around with the styling of your personal landing page to personalize it to your tastes and aesthetics.
