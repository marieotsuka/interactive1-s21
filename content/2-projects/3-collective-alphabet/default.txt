Text:

To kickoff P1, we’ll work together to make a collective, modular, alphabet. Keep in mind… What is a modular typeface? What are strategic ways of drawing letters? What are expressive ways of drawing letters using a systemic approach (like the provided)? 

We’ll be working in this file for the exercise: [Collective Alphabet in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/M299j2lBT09ZiySVUNxTiJ/Collective-Alphabet-Exercise?node-id=0%3A1)

**Instructions Part 1**
In Part 1 of the exercise, you will draw a series of characters in black and white using a 12x12 grid in Figma. 
1. Open the [Collective Alphabet in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/M299j2lBT09ZiySVUNxTiJ/Collective-Alphabet-Exercise?node-id=0%3A1) file
2. Find your name in the file, you’ll be responsible for designing the row next to and below your name.
3. You’ll see that there are two 12x12 grids per letter. In the left column, highlight cells in *black* to draw the assigned letter by changing the fill of each square. 

**Instructions Part 2**
In Part 2 of the exercise, you will exchange letters with your classmates, and using their work as a base – create a colored ‘state’ of their letters.
1. In the same file, move down to the next row. For instance if chris drew A and B, and Dom drew C and D – chris would work with C and D, and Dom with C and D, and so on for the rest of the alphabet. The designer with & and * will work with A and B in this step of the exercise. 
2. In your selected letter’s right column, using the design made in part 1 as a starting point, explore the use of color, patterns and images to draw a new version of those characters.

**Next Steps**
In the same [project (CSS Typeface)](https://www.figma.com/files/project/22905785/CSS-Typeface) in Figma, create a new file and name it [lastname_firstname-type_sketches]. In this file design two unique _modular_ directions for each of your “Collective Alphabet” characters. This means 4 designs total. Each character can reuse a concept, or have a totally unique design.
