Text:

This exercise is a “takehome test” to review the techniques covered so far in the semester. However, unlike traditional tests this is “open note” — you have access to all resources available to you, whether from class materials or via online research.

The assignment is to recreate this poster by Joseph Müller-Brockmann in HTML & CSS.

## Additional Parameters
- Keep in mind how you are grouping and nesting your content for alignement purposes
- Poster should have a maximum width of `850px` and a height of `1200px` *until the viewport is narrower*
- On screens narrower than `850px`, the width should take up 80% of the browser width. Consider how the layout / elements adjust to a narrower screen — for example, would the number of squares be reduced? Would the text layout be simplified to a single column?
- Add an animation that changes the color of the blue squares to red when hovering over each square

Try to keep your code as simple and organized as possible. There is no one right way of completing this, however, it’s important to consider the organization of your code — keep in mind the DRY principle: `Don’t Repeat Yourself` — and use resuable classes whenever possible, taking advantage of the inheritance/cascade of CSS.

## Hints: Key CSS Properties
- `mix-blend-mode`
- `transform`
