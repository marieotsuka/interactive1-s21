Graphic design already is a faster executed medium. It also has a shorter lifespan. You donâ€™t want a poster to be around for too long. It has a time specific or a location specific purpose. After the event has taken place or so on, you are quite happy for the poster to be torn down or a new poster to be hung up at the same place. In a way, web is an even faster progression of that. You can develop something with little budget and you can almost instantly publish it, if you have the tools available to code.
