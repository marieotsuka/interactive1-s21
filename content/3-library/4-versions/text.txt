German psychologist Max Wertheimer wrote in 1909:

I break a stick in two. One approach says, I now have “two.” (Two what? That’s immaterial, I have two—new—units.) The arithmetic makes a jump: first there is one, a stick, then there are two... and between the first and the second state of affairs there is a gap, which is ignored.

But we’ll call a stick a stick. Better yet, let’s call it one stick then two, not forgetting that “one” and “two” are words and therefore merely point to external concepts. It doesn’t help much using the digits “1” and “2” instead—they’re symbols, too.
